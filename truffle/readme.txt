Truffle Framework :
    - Allows us to build decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain
    - Provides a suite of tools that allow us to write smart contacts with the Solidity programming language
    - Enables us to test our smart contracts and deploy them to the blockchain
    - Gives us a place to develop our client-side application

Ganache:
A local in-memory blockchain,
It will give us 10 external accounts with addresses on our local Ethereum blockchain. 
Each account is preloaded with 100 fake ether


Commands:
npm run migrate - use after make changes in contracts to update the contracts in the blockchain.

truffle console - use to interact with contract via terminal

npm run test - use to run all contracts tests with truffle

npm run dev - use to start a local server to serve the client website
